# React Countdown timer

Hi guys!

Here you are a very useful **countdown timer** made in **React.js**

It has been thought like a **component** that you can use in other projects.

I am developing a **game** where I need a countdown timer **to stop it**, so I decided to develop this part like an independent project.

## Scripts to start the project:

**1 -** Clone the project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/lauraportillo/react-countdown-timer.git
```

**2 -** Install the dependencies:

npm install
```

**3 -** Run the project:

```sh

ðŸ‘‰ And save the **time needed** in React state:

```js
//state
const [hours, setHours] = useState(1);
const [minutes, setMinutes] = useState(30);
const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);
```
