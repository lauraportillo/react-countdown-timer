# React Countdown timer (readme in progress)

Hi guys!

Here you are a very useful countdown timer made in React.js
It has been thought like a component that you can use in other projects.
I am developing a game where I need a countdown timer to stop it, so I decided to develop this part like an independent project.

ðŸ‘‰ Save the time needed in React state:

//state
const [hours, setHours] = useState(1);
const [minutes, setMinutes] = useState(30);
const [seconds, setSeconds] = useState(0);

Scripts to start the project:

- Clone the project:
  git clone https://github.com/lauraportillo/react-countdown-timer.git

- Install the dependencies:
  npm install

- Run the project:
  npm start
